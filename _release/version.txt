- Correctly handle shortcut alphabetic sorting
- Added config option to create title shortcuts with smdh title as filename instead of title ID (default is smdh title). This option has to be manually edited in config.xml for now.
- Shortcuts can be deleted pressing B button over them (a confirmation prompt will appear)
- Creating a shortcut for a gamecard will generate a standard shortcut for all gamecards
- Prevent launching gamecard via Region4 trough shortcut if there's no gamecard (notification prompt appears)

22 jan 2016 - 22:00 GTM+1
- Restored "scanMenuEntry(me);" in main.c which caused some boot problems in previous build (don't know why I removed it, probably removed by mistake).
- Updated to latest HBL 1.1.0 changes (except file browsing), including latest ctrulib.
- Tweaked title browser, it should be now lag free, keys properly work and inserting/extracting the game cartridge is also properly recognized.
- Disabled alpha channel for now since rendering with transparency produces lag (and has been reported as much worse on o3ds).
- Compiled with latest ctrulib.

- Press start in config menu to shutdown (config will not be saved)
- Added option to change default title booting method (HANS/R4)
- If boot method is R4, created shortcuts will boot R4
Note: unlike hans shortcuts, R4 shortcuts will only work with this mod, they won't show on any other.

- Changed toolbar sprites, thanks fiese_nase for concept art!
- Toolbar now fades with theme alpha setting, but only for vertical position since horizontal looks weird due to overlaying with entries.

31 oct 2015 - 01:05 GTM+1
- Add alpha, button border color and button state color to themes.

- Shrinked and moved entries a little to (and fixed some smdh text not correctly wrapping, i.e. FTP-3DS)
- Scrollbar is resized when toolbar is in vertical position.
- Folder change when swiping will only activate moving horizontally (previously it could be activated by diagonal movement, conflicting with scrolling)
- Bugfixes:
	* Missing last folder in folder list menu

	* Fixed bug introduced with swiping code

29 oct 2015 - 00:50 GTM+1

- Created Hans shortcuts will have author "Hans shortcut"
- Shortcuts have a different icon frame color
- Configurable icon frame color for apps and shortcuts
- Disable args for hans loading since hans uses a file with the low title id by default

27 oct 2015 - 00:00 GTM+1

26 oct 2015 - 19:45 GTM+1
- Title launcher can create and delete title shortcuts to/from current folder.

26 oct 2015 - 18:11 GTM+1
- Title launcher now runs trough HANS (aka region 5) if one of the following paths is valid:
	* /3ds/hans/hans.3dsx
	* /3ds/.hans/h/hans.3dsx --> this path is so hans won't be displayed in HBL
If hans is not found in neither of this paths, old method (region 4) will be used.

26 oct 2015 - 17:30 GTM+1

- Merged latest changes from smea's master.

19 oct 2015 - 13:55 GTM+1
- Filters are not applied when searching for services/titles defined in descriptor xml file
