- Created Hans shortcuts will have author "Hans shortcut"
- Shortcuts have a different icon frame color
- Configurable icon frame color for apps and shortcuts

- Title launcher now runs trough HANS (aka region 5) if one of the following paths is valid:
	* /3ds/hans/hans.3dsx
	* /3ds/.hans/h/hans.3dsx --> this path is so hans won't be displayed in HBL
If hans is not found in neither of this paths, old method (region 4) will be used.

- Filters are not applied when searching for services/titles defined in descriptor xml file
